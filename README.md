Dapr-WASM enables you to run WASM code in Dapr.

> This is a very early preview of the experimental code to run wasm code using dapr capabilities, and you should expect breaking changes before the first stable release.

### Project description
This project is based on dapr and adds wasm support to run wasm code in dapr. wasm code can use dapr capabilities, such as service call, pubsub, etc.

### Architecture
! [image-20230305161929424](https://image-1255620078.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/image-20230305161929424.png)

### Advantages
1. no need to write any glue code, just wasm function code
2. wasm is lightweightï¼Œ security, isolation and has other features
3. allow wasm code to use dapr capabilities such as service call, pubsub, etc. So wasm applications can focus entirely on business logic

### eamples
In the project `examples` directory, there is a simple example that can receive network requests and use state store to store and fetch data.
##### 1. Compile the wasm code
```shell
cd examples/service-call
make
```
##### 2. Run dapr
Install and initialize dapr

Run the `make run-example` command in the home directory
##### 3. Send the request
```shell
# Set the value
curl http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/go-wasm-app/method/service-call/set -d 'value1'
# Query, this should return value1
curl http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/go-wasm-app/method/service-call/get
```

### Next step
Refine features and details
Add wasm instance pool, which can reuse wasm instance as well as parallelize requests
Now it is wasm->wasm-dapr(wasm host + dapr sdk) -> dapr,later will explore directly on dapr long, wasm->dapr.
